The goal of this homeowork was to generate a dashboard that displayed summaries of the sample data. There is a dropdown function that allows the user to select which test subject they would like to view the data of. The data for the specified test subjeect is displyed in a few different formats. There is a panel that displays the subject's demographic info. There is a horizontal bar graph that displays the top 10 bacteria strains. There is also a bubble graph that displays all of the bacteria strains collected from the subject. The sizes of the bubbles are based off of the size of the sample values. Both graphs are interactive, so the user can scroll over and a pop-up will appear with more info.
